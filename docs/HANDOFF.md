# Local operational notes

Personal inventories, execution logs and handoff history are kept outside the public repository.

## Chunked session reading — 2026-10-01
Completed explanations support section/full reading, recoverable notes with inspectable citations, and optional reasoning requests preserving drafts. Versioned prompt supports readable sections; navigation and large-text layout improved. Backend378/frontend168, lint/types/build and three isolated browser journeys pass. Independent review found no remaining blockers/majors. Model compliance, actual microphone and learner outcomes remain unmeasured. No runtime data or private sources included.

## Silent video outcomes — 2026-10-01
Optional ffprobe checks MP4/M4V/MOV/MKV/WebM/AVI before speech decoding. Confirmed video-only streams become no_content; unknown/malformed/failed probes retain decoder behavior. Original assets unchanged. 390 backend tests and full lint/types pass; independent review no blockers/majors. Other video suffixes keep prior behavior. Existing running worker is deliberately not restarted; historical run errors remain intact, new workers use the improved classification.
