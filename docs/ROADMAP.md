# Roadmap

The local-first tutor supports knowledge areas, source-based lessons, practice, review, local material import, coding and audio exploration. See README.md for setup and current capabilities. Personal corpus inventories and measured private-course results are not published.

- Shared audio controls: implemented and browser-tested (2026-10-01); physical headphone audibility remains owner verification. See docs/slices/shared-audio-controls.md.

## Task notebook round trip — 2026-10-01
Try can open a section-specific local starter with a CSV, separate inspectable calculation checks, and return checked output to preserved project notes. Edits invalidate success; Back remains available. 177 frontend tests, lint/types/build, isolated real-Pyodide Chromium journey and required code/pedagogy re-review pass. No new backend API or progress claims. See docs/slices/task-notebook-roundtrip.md.

## Inline answer feedback and question audio — 2026-10-01
Think deeper exposes Check my answer using the existing session/tutor routing; question, criteria and worked example are supplied. Selected question, revealed hint/checklist and returned feedback have explicit listening controls. Edits invalidate old feedback; text changes stop/reset speech. 180 frontend tests, lint/types/build, isolated fake-tutor Chromium journey and required reviews pass. Real model correctness and headphone audibility are not certified. See docs/slices/project-answer-feedback.md.

## Local notebook lab from app — 2026-10-01
Notebook workspace can prepare an explicit private bundle, preserve existing edits, install/repair pinned base tools on request and start loopback authenticated Jupyter. No cells execute automatically. Eight backend regressions, 181 frontend tests, lint/build, isolated browser journey and code/pedagogy reviews pass; real launch returned ready and HTTP 200. Course-specific legacy dependencies remain a separate compatibility task. See docs/slices/local-notebook-launch.md.

- 2026-10-01: bounded draw.io text ingestion implemented and reviewed; see docs/slices/diagram-ingestion.md.

- 2026-10-01: archive-member retry preserves completed work; see docs/slices/archive-retry.md.

- 2026-10-01: current tutor explanation controls implemented; Q2 remains partial, including model adherence. See docs/slices/tutor-explanation-controls.md.

- 2026-10-01: StudyTutor elapsed waiting, nearby Stop and completion announcement verified; see docs/slices/tutor-waiting.md.

- 2026-10-01: notebook native file-input width constrained; all33 local browser journeys pass. See docs/slices/notebook-responsive-input.md.

- 2026-10-01: assessment help/feedback widget identity collision fixed; see docs/slices/assessment-widget-identity.md.

- 2026-10-01: shared tutor waiting/completion and immediate playground Stop verified; see docs/slices/shared-tutor-status.md.


### 2026-10-01 — bounded workspace arithmetic feedback

Implemented literal numeric equality checks, separate from model guidance and learning evidence.542 backend tests, 228 frontend tests, lint and independent review pass. Actual local feedback still has tag/interpretation failures; full tutor quality remains open. See docs/slices/workspace-arithmetic-checks.md.


### 2026-10-01 — bounded formative answer checks

Explicit answer-check integration completed; see docs/slices/explicit-answer-feedback.md. Broader teaching-quality and unrelated gates remain open.


### 2026-10-01 — completed-answer save recovery

Retry saving without regeneration implemented. Process-bound one-hour receipts; lost-delivery and request-level inference idempotency remain open. See docs/slices/answer-save-recovery.md.


## 2026-10-01 — durable workspace request foundation

Optional UUID Idempotency-Key on workspace tutor now claims a learner-scoped SQLite row
before inference. Same payload replays the original completed response; changed payload
conflicts, and running/interrupted claims never silently generate again. Records export/wipe
with learner data; session deletion cascades. Six regression tests, full backend568 and lint
passed; disposable snapshot migration upgrade/downgrade and independent code review clear.
UI does not send keys yet: next implement persistent retry identity, explicit new-request
choice, storage-failure handling and browser journeys. Main lesson/voice request dedup remains
separate. See docs/slices/workspace-request-recovery.md. Both repositories remain private.
Previous recovery commits041e7b6/cefa84a now have successful remote CI.


## 2026-10-02 — workspace retry controls connected

Study Tutor and Playground now send durable request UUIDs and freeze original payloads in
tab-scoped session storage. Retry previous request recovers without a second generation;
replacing unresolved work requires explicit discard. Earlier-feedback labels and typed edits
are retained. Denied storage offers explicit in-memory continuation with honest reload limits.
Full frontend241 before final fix, final focused35, lint/build and five isolated browser
journeys passed. Code review storage-denial major fixed and re-reviewed; pedagogy review clear.
See docs/slices/workspace-request-recovery.md. Saved-follow-up, lesson-stream and voice request
identities remain separate; broader content-correction, UX, materials and visual queues remain
open. Foundation commits31ef40a/89fa9f6 passed both remote CI workflows. Both repos private.


## 2026-10-02 — saved follow-up retry recovery

Saved-answer follow-ups now share durable request identities. Fingerprints include parent
answer and route plus typed question/session; owner checks precede replay. The UI freezes
parent/question, restores explicit retry after reload and retains a newly edited next draft.
Changed feedback cannot silently regenerate an old request. Full backend570/frontend243,
lint/build, seven isolated recovery journeys and required code/pedagogy reviews passed.
No paid inference, new dependency or migration. See docs/slices/followup-request-recovery.md.
Lesson-stream/voice request recovery and broader correction/UX/material/visual queues remain
open. Both repositories remain private; private snapshot refreshed before commit.


## 2026-10-02 — lesson transport recovery foundation

SSE and buffered lesson API now accept a shared UUID request identity. Original terminal meta/
done (including partial outcome) persist before delivery; replay repeats neither inference,
explained events nor checkpoint writes. Unresolved claims do not rerun. Failure copy no longer
claims nothing changed after a late persistence error. Six regression tests, full backend576,
lint/types and code/pedagogy reviews passed. No new migration, dependency or paid calls.
Browser identity/preserved partial-text integration remains next, with explicit replay metadata
and hint-evidence gating required before shipping it; see docs/slices/lesson-request-recovery.md.
Voice remains separate. Both repos private, broader project queues still open.


## Lesson browser recovery — 2026-10-02

Scoped lesson requests now survive reload with their exact retry identity, received text and
unsent draft. Explicit retry/discard controls and storage failure notices preserve choice.
Recovered metadata cannot reapply lesson hints; checkpoint hint evidence survives reload.
Question-help remains ephemeral and isolated. Backend576/frontend250 plus final hook12,
lint/types/build and three isolated browser journeys passed. Code/pedagogy review major fixed
and re-reviewed clear. See docs/slices/lesson-request-recovery.md. Voice lifecycle recovery,
question-help persistence and broader queues remain open; no personal voice gate claim.


## Voice interruption fence — 2026-10-02

Interrupt retains displayed text, suppresses queued audio/content and waits for both terminal
and acknowledgement before accepting new work. Empty transcription is a terminal path; stale
timers cannot close the next turn. Cleanup timeout closes the socket with explicit reconnect.
Persistent wording distinguishes partial display from separately saved completed replies.
Frontend254, lint/types/build and strict fake socket/microphone tests passed. Independent code
and pedagogy findings were fixed and re-reviewed clear. No live audio benchmark claim. Full
voice reload/identity recovery remains open; implementation sequence is recorded in
`docs/slices/voice-interruption-recovery.md`. Previous lesson CI passed in both repositories.


## Voice text/draft recovery — 2026-10-02

Voice panels retain bounded tab-local transcript, reply text and unsent draft, scoped by session,
skill, language and conversation. Restore stays disconnected, without audio or receipts; text
is explicitly potentially incomplete. Stop preserves work; Clear removes it and failed storage
clear keeps the panel open. Context changes dispose the previous connection. Frontend258,
lint/types/build and two isolated desktop/narrow keyboard journeys passed; zero voice sockets
opened by recovery. Required reviews clear. See docs/slices/voice-text-recovery.md. Server voice
turn identity and terminal text retrieval remain next; no full voice recovery/benchmark claim.
